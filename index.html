<h2>Car Pool Kerfuffle</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>CONTROLS</strong>
Arrow keys move left and right. Press space to punch. Press the up arrow key to double jump. 
</li>
<li><strong>High Concept: Literally dodging traffic</strong>
Cars from above and below block your path, speed through!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals: Moderate</strong>
There's no real way to lose, simply fun for those who like to go fast.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre: Platformer</strong>
The mechanics are slightly ambiguous here. Cars are defeated when a player outpaces them each 7 times. The jump mechanics and momentum make this a platformer at heart.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player controls a car in a hurry to get to a job interview. Jumping is key in order to getting around cars, and an additional jump can be performed while airborne. 
Make it past all the cars to win.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Momentum and collision with multiple sprites.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Reflex training and obstacle course navigation.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player is driving a car, hoping to make it to an interview on time. Traffic is slow and you are fast.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
This is the day. The life changing interview of your life holds your love life in the balance. You're wife is pregnant. Your cat has been addicted to underground boxing. Your dog has turned evil. This is your chance to turn things around.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who appreciate fast.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Depends on how fast you are. Reasonably about a minute.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Jump on top of cars and time your double jumps when needed.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Phaser documents online.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Starstruck, loosely.
